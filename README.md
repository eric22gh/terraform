Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eric, a professional from the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (C.C.S.S). Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of AWS, Linux, Terraform, and SQL, learning and growing in these technologies.

Description
This Terraform script automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure, specifically creating three EC2 instances with different configurations and tagging them accordingly. It establishes a scalable and robust AWS infrastructure, laying the groundwork for hosting applications with AWS services.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently in the process of putting my knowledge into practice.
ðŸŒ± I'm learning more about AWS, Linux, Cisco, Terraform, and strengthening my skills in SQL.
ðŸ’¬ You can contact me at e.a.edwards12@hotmail.com.

âš¡ AWS Riddle:
I'm an AWS service that sounds like a river in the jungle,
I store data, but I'm not a shelf in a star.
You know me well, I'm easy to remember,
Who am I? You can use me for objects you want to keep!

âœ¨ My Wishes:
I aim to not only improve my technical skills but also to create innovative solutions that positively impact the healthcare field. I'm passionate about contributing to people's well-being through technology.

Hope you enjoy exploring my repositories!
